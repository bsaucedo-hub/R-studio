# Project Title

R Studio Analysis for Biol 668

## Description

This repository contains R-based analyses for the Biol 668 course in Spring 2025. It includes an R lab notebook and two additional files used for the final project, focusing on statistical tests, data wrangling, and visualization. The analyses involve the use of basic statistical functions, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression modeling, and diversity analysis using R libraries such as ggplot2, vegan, and base R functions.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

R 4.x or higher

RStudio

R Libraries:

  ggplot2 (for data visualization)

  vegan (for ecological and diversity analysis)

  Base R libraries (stats, graphics, etc.)

### Installing

Download this repository.

Ensure that you have R and RStudio installed on your system. You can download R from here and RStudio from here.

Open the .Rmd or .R files in RStudio to run the analyses.

No additional installations are required for the provided libraries if R is already set up.

### Executing program

Open RStudio and load the notebook.

Run each R chunk using the "Run" button in RStudio, or use Ctrl + Shift + Enter to execute a chunk.

For HTML output, knit the R Markdown file to produce an HTML notebook:

  rmarkdown::render("your_file.Rmd")

You can also use standard R scripts (.R) for specific analyses by running them directly in the R console.

## Help

Common issues:

Make sure your working directory is correctly set in RStudio, especially when reading in data files.

setwd("your/directory/path")

If you run into issues with missing libraries, install them via:

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("vegan")
